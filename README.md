# Apple and AI

## Overview and Origin 

* Apple Inc.

* Founded: 3 January 1977

* Founders: Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne

* A lot of others will look at new and exciting headline grabbing companies. While I was tempted by Seer Interactive founded by the very impressive Wil Reynolds, Sherpa Ai, Tempus and IBM (Watson), each of these companies are very impressive. I've always been swayed by privacy centric Companies that are trying to make a difference in the world. Apple has been striving to help people achieve the best they can by providing devices and services that people can use to achieve this. The Company has been one of the best places I have worked for and hope to again someday. 

* Apple is self funding now but initially it is said that the Company raised $250 000 from Mike Markkula followed by 3 rounds of funding [1].

## Business Activities

* Apple's mission statement originally was:
>   ''Apple is dedicated to the empowerment of manâ€”to making personal computing accessible to each and every individual so as to help change the way we think, work, learn, and communicate.''

* This has changed a little since then but essentially the focus of the Company remains the same. Apple is putting 					faith in providing quality products to allow us to change the world leaving it better than we found it.

* Essentially everyone is Apple's intended Customer. While the initial cost of their products might be seen as expensive (if you do not factor in customisation to match specs) the company continues to iterate and use their production cycle to produce products cheaper and cheaper to reach more people. 

* The Apple ecosystem offering both hardware and software solutions is something that other competitors cannot match. It has been called a ''Walled Garden'' at times that can be seen as an unfair advantage. An example of this is the App Store and the monopoly Apple has here. More on the technologies they use below.

## Landscape

* Apple is in a number of industries, hardware (computers, monitors, wearables including Vision Pro), software (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS), AI, Media (Apple TV and their production studios) and Heath (eg Apple Fitness).

*  In the last 5 years the introduction of the Apple Silicon for Mobile/Wearable devices as well as the M Series Chips for computers. The imminent arrival of Spatial computing with Vision Pro an interesting new era for computers. This has ushered in on device ML with such examples as multi-task neural architecture used by the Photos app [2]. The company has been making moves acquiring a variety of AI companies that are believed to drive all their devices [3].

* Google, Samsung and Microsoft would be Apple's biggest competitors.

## Results

* Apple has changed the way people use and access technology. They are known for Accessibility considerations and helping people through Design and User Experience discover new ways to use their products. The sheer number of apps in the App Store shown that there a multiple new developers who have been inspired to take up coding and running their own development businesses. This in turn has allowed the revenue generated and people employed to contribute to multiple countries economies.  Apple also employs many people worldwide helping boost local economies. Their suppliers in turn are able to employe more people and turn around profits and benefit their local economies. Apple has also helped drive the industry to become/move to as close as carbon neutral as possible. This would help fight climate change. 

* The core metrics that are used to measure Apple's success include their market cap. Currently they are valued at 2.6 billion dollars. [4] According to the Verge [5] there are over 2 billion Apple devices in use signalling their reach. 

* On Mobile Apple has a 54% market share in the US but Android globally has a 70% lead [6]. For combined desktop and notebooks, Apple has an 8% global presence but grown 60% in the last 3 years [7].


## Recommendations

* The next steps would be to double down on improving Siri. Utilising the chip advantage they have to introduce AI/ML powered AR Glasses that would be able to perform on device tasks reducing reliance on the iPhone to accomplish this. Users would be able to use the Glasses as a HUD to follow directions, for social purposes like using them to locate friends at events. Users would also be able to us the HUD to follow contruction directions for example (looking at you Ikea). For Apple the ability to weave all the AI company purchases and weave them into the software that will utilise the hardware on the roadmap. Their advantage is to introduce AI/ML in a way that is invisible and seamless. The proof with Apple is always in the pudding. For Apple Users the hand that AI/ML will take will be invisible, felt rather than advertised as they have been in the AAI/ML game without drawing too much attention to it since the introduction of Siri. All of Apple's products and services are prime targets for utilising AI/ML, from AirPods with their Adaptive Audio to the Apple Watch and on device ML and heath recommendations for example.
